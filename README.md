# Position monitoring
 
This is console app, written in C#. It sets in motion virtual players. They are moving asynchronously in random positions with random speed. By the end of time, you can check which player traveled the longest way. I'v used [Pastel](https://github.com/silkfire/Pastel) library to get nice, colored field.
